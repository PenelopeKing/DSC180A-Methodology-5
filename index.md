## Prompts
**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

Learning about graph neural networks and different types of architectures (GAT, GCN, GIN) was really interesting. Especially learning aout their applications, strengths, and weaknesses.

**3. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I want to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project would be to do text summarization using graph transformers on knowledge graphs. Specifically it would be intersting to have a graph transformer be able to perform text summarization on a large corpus of text by being able to figure out what informatin is important and be able to give a summary of the important information in the text.

**4. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would make to my approack taken in my current Quarter 1 Project would be to baseline my models in such a way so that they are comparable / comproable. This will ensure a fair comparison. My professor recommended giving each model benchmark the "same amount of attention" in terms of paramters, space, etc.

**5. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Other techniques I would be interested in using in my project would be to maybe use parallel computing and have my code run more eficiently for my quarter 1 project. I also want to maybe add new GNNs to compare too.
For my quarter 2 project I want to use knowledge graphs and reasoning graphs, which is a field I am not as familiar in. A new technique for the quarter 2 project that would be interesting would be abstractive summarization.
